Mod Created By:	Doicm (decentdoicm)

Special Thanks:	WoFF modding community for tools and information,
and Surihia for csv/csh conversion tool that this tool uses.

Version: 
==================================================================
0.1.0

Notes:
==================================================================

1.) In order to install and uninstall this, you will need to 
locate your WOFF executable as part of the process.
To find, go to Steam and right-click the game "World of Final
Fantasy, click Manage -> Browse local files.... It should take
you to the folder. 

2.) I highly recommend creating a backup of your primary
save file. You can usually find it on Windows in the following:

&ensp;%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\WOFF\<user-id>\savedata\

or in Linux on the following:

&ensp;<SteamLibrary-folder>/steamapps/compatdata/552700/pfx/

Description:
==================================================================
This mod is designed to work with World of Final Fantasy: Maxima
for Steam. However, it may work without Maxima expansion, but I
have no way of testing it. 

This mod shuffles most of the nodes around on the mirageboards.
This mod also makes a few other adjustments to prevent softlocks, 
such as replacing some nodes in mirageboards for Tama, Sylph, and 
Chocochick (the three automatically obtained mirages) with 
field abilities if used in conjunction with enemy randomizer, as
well as locks some field abilities for other earlier mirages.

Instructions:
==================================================================
Find the latest release in the releases section on Github, then
download the zip and extract it to a destination of your choosing.
Run MBRando.exe and follow the directions for installing. 

WARNING: If you are using the enemy randomizer, install the enemy
randomizer first before installing the mirageboard randomizer.

When it comes time to uninstalling, uninstall the mirageboard
randomizer first, then uninstall the enemy randomizer.

If you run into issues with uninstalling, you should be able to 
restore your files by verifying your files on Steam. Hopefully
it won't come to this, but this is just in case.
